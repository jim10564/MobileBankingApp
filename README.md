# MobileBankingProgram
## Java mobile banking application, uses LinkedLists, and Inheritance
This project represents a mobile banking application. A user can create an account, make withdrawals and deposits, and calculate future earnings on investments.  
## How it works
Bank account objects are added to a linked list when a user creates an account. From there several methods manipulate the bank account objects, in the form of depsits, withdrawals, and transfers. The program has a view account statements method, which calls the toString method, of all the bank account objects on the linked lists.
